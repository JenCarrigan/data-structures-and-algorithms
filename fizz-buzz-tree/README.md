# FizzBuzz Tree
Using binary trees
 ## Challenge
Write a function called FizzBuzzTree which takes a tree as an argument.
Without utilizing any of the built-in methods available to your language, determine weather or not the value of each node is divisible by 3, 5 or both, and change the value of each of the nodes respectively. Return the tree with itâ€™s news values.
 ## Approach & Efficiency
The solution takes O(n) since we'll have to visit every node. For space it will be O(h) where h is the height of the tree.
