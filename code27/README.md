# Intersection of binary trees

Find common values in 2 binary trees.

## Challenge
Write a function called tree_intersection that takes two binary tree parameters.
Without utilizing any of the built-in library methods available to your language, return a set of values found in both trees.

## Approach & Efficiency
We took an O(n) approach on both time and space.
