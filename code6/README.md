# Linked List Insertions
In our linked list class from before, we add three new methods of Append, InsertBefore, and InsertAfter

## Challenge
.append(value) which adds a new node with the given value to the end of the list
.insertBefore(value, newVal) which add a new node with the given newValue immediately before the first value node
.insertAfter(value, newVal) which add a new node with the given newValue immediately after the first value node
You have access to the Node class and all the properties on the Linked List class.
