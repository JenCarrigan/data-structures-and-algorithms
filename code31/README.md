# Breadth-First Traversal of a Graph

Implement a breadth-first traversal on a graph.

## Challenge
Extend your graph object with a breadth-first traversal method that accepts a starting node. Without utilizing any of the built-in methods available to your language, return a collection of nodes in the order they were visited. Display the collection.

## Approach & Efficiency
Our solution is O(n^2) on time, because it has a for loop inside a while loop.
For space, it is O(n) since we have to create an array with the same values.
